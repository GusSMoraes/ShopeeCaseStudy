Considering that scenario, build a script, implementing the seller's ranking logic, where the user, from the terminal, inputs a Sale item and the output is printed as an updated list of all sales registered, sorted by sellers with the highest to lowest amount sold.

Premises:
- A Sale item must have at least the following attributes: (Seller Name, Customer Name, Date of Sale, Sale Item Name, Sale Value)
- Five Sellers should be registered and no Sale Item can be registered with a different seller name other than the five available.
- Script must run in the terminal only
- Script should be delivered as a Git repository hosted in GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket with instructions on how to execute it.

# Requeriments
- Python (https://www.python.org)
